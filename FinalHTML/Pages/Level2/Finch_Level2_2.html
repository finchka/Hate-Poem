            <h1>Hate Poem</h1>
            <h2><a href="../../Menu/index.html" title="Look out!"><font color="black">Julie Sheehan</font></a></h2>
        <p>
        <strong>I hate you truly</strong>. Truly I do.<br>
        Everything about me hates everything about you.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>The flick of my wrist hates you.</li>
            <li>The way I hold my pencil hates you.</li>
            <li>The sound made by my tiniest bones were they trapped in the jaws of a moray eel hates you.</li>
            <li>Each corpuscle singing in its capillary hates you.</li>
        </ul>
        Look out! Fore! <strong>I hate you</strong>.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>The little blue-green speck of sock lint I'm trying to dig from under my third toenail, left foot, hates you.</li>
            <li>The history of this keychain hates you</li>
            <li>My sigh in the background as you pick out the cashews hates you.</li>
            <li>The goldfish of my genius hates you.</li>
            <li>My aorta hates you. Also my ancestors</li>
            </ul>
        A closed window is both a closed window and an obvious symbol of how <strong>I hate you</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        My voice curt as a hairshirt:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=../Level1/Finch_Level1_2.html title="The flick of my wrist hates you"><font color="black"><em>hate</em></a>.<br>
        My hesitation when you invite me for a drive:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>hate</em>.<br>
        My pleasant "good morning":<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>hate</em>.<br>
        You know how when I'm sleepy I nuzzle my head under your arm?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Hate</em>.<br>
        <br>
        The whites of my target-eyes articulate hate. My wit practices it.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>My breasts relaxing in their holster from morning to night hate you.</li>
            </ul>
        Layers of hate, <em>a parfait</em>.<br>
        <br>
        Hours after our latest row, brandishing the sharp glee of hate,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dissect you cell by cell, so that I might hate each one individually and at leisure.<br>
        My lungs, duplicitous twins, expand with the utter validity of my hate, which can never have enough of you,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathlessly, like two idealists in a broken submarine.<br>
        <br>
