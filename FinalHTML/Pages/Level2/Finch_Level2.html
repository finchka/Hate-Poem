            <h2>Julie Sheehan</h2>
        <p>
        I <strong>hate</strong> you truly. <em>Truly I do</em><br>
        Everything about <em>me</em> hates everything about <em>you</em>.<br>
        The flick of my wrist <strong>hates</strong> you.<br>
        The way I hold my pencil <strong>hates</strong> you.<br>
        The sound made by my tiniest bones were they trapped in the jaws of a moray eel <strong>hates</strong><br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.<br>
        Each corpuscle singing in its capillary <strong>hates</strong> you.<br>
        <br>
            Look out! Fore! <em>I hate you</em>.<br>
        <br>
        The little blue-green speck of sock lint I'm trying to dig from under my third toenail, left<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foot, <strong>hates</strong> you.<br>
        The history of this keychain <strong>hates</strong> you.<br>
        My sigh in the background as you pick out the cashews <strong>hates</strong> you.<br>
        The goldfish of my genius <strong>hates</strong> you.<br>
        My aorta <strong>hates</strong> you. Also my ancestors.<br>
        <br>
        A closed window is both a closed window and an obvious symbol of how <em>I hate you</em>.<br>
        <br>
        My voice curt as a hairshirt: <strong>hate</strong>.<br>
        My hesitation when you invite me for a drive: <strong>hate</strong>.<br>
        My pleasant "good morning": <strong>hate</strong>.<br>
        You know how when I'm sleepy I nuzzle my head under your arm? <strong>Hate</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        The whites of my target-eyes articulate <strong>hate</strong>. My wit practices it.<br>
        My breasts relaxing in their holster from morning to night <strong>hate</strong> you.<br>
        Layers of <strong>hate</strong>, a parfait.<br>
        Hours after our latest row, brandishing the sharp glee of <strong>hate</strong>,<br>
        I dissect you cell by cell, so that I might <strong>hate</strong> each one individually and at leisure.<br>
        My lungs, duplicitous twins, expand with the utter validity of my <strong>hate</strong>, which can never<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have enough of you,<br>
        Breathlessly, like two idealists in a broken submarine.<br>
        <br>
