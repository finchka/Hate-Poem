        <font color="red">I HATE you truly. Truly I do.<br>
        <br>
        Everything about me HATES everything about you.<br>
        The flick of my wrist HATES you.<br>
        The way I hold my pencil HATES you.<br>
        The sound made by my tiniest bones were they trapped in the jaws of a moray eel HATES you.<br>
        Each corpuscle singing in its capillary HATE you.<br>
        <br>
        Look out! Fore! I HATE you.<br>
        <br>
        The little blue-green speck of sock lint I'm trying to dig from under my third toenail, left foot,HATES you.<br>
        The history of this keychain HATES you.<br>
        My sigh in the background as you pick out the cashews HATES you.<br>
        The goldfish of my genius HATES you.<br>
        My aorta HATES you. Also my ancestors.<br>
        <br>
        A closed window is both a closed window and an obvious symbol of how I HATE you.<br>
        My voice curt as a hairshirt: HATE.<br>
        My hesitation when you invite me for a drive: HATE.<br>
        My pleasant "good morning": HATE.<br>
        You know how when I'm sleepy I nuzzle my head under your arm? HATE.<br>
        <br>
        The whites of my target-eyes articulate HATE. My wit practices it.
        My breasts relaxing in their holster from morning to night HATE you.<br>
        Layers of HATE, a parfait.<br>
        Hours after our latest row, brandishing the sharp glee of HATE,
        I dissect you cell by cell, so that I might HATE each one individually and at leisure.<br>
        My lungs, duplicitous twins, expand with the utter validity of my HATE, which can never have enough of you,<br>
        Breathlessly, like two idealists in a broken submarine.<br>
