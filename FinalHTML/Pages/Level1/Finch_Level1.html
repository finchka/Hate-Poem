            <h1>Hate Poem</h1>
            <h2>Julie Sheehan</h2>
        <p>
        I hate you truly. Truly I do.<br>
        Everything about me hates everything about you.<br>
        The flick of my wrist hates you.<br>
        The way I hold my pencil hates you.<br>
        The sound made by my tiniest bones were they trapped in the jaws of a moray eel hates<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.<br>
        Each corpuscle singing in its capillary hates you.<br>
        <br>
        Look out! Fore! I hate you.<br>
        <br>
        The little blue-green speck of sock lint I'm trying to dig from under my third toenail, left<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foot, hates you.<br>
        The history of this keychain hates you.<br>
        My sigh in the background as you pick out the cashews hates you.<br>
        The goldfish of my genius hates you.<br>
        My aorta hates you. Also my ancestors.<br>
        <br>
        A closed window is both a closed window and an obvious symbol of how I hate you.<br>
        <br>
        My voice curt as a hairshirt: hate.<br>
        My hesitation when you invite me for a drive: hate.<br>
        My pleasant <a href="../../Menu/goodmorning.html"><font color="black">"good morning"</font></a>: hate.<br>
        You know how when I'm sleepy I nuzzle my head under your arm? Hate.<br>
        <br>
        The whites of my target-eyes articulate hate. My wit practices it.<br>
        My breasts relaxing in their holster from morning to night hate you.<br>
        Layers of hate, a parfait.<br>
        Hours after our latest row, brandishing the sharp glee of hate,<br>
        I dissect you cell by cell, so that I might hate each one individually and at leisure.<br>
        My lungs, duplicitous twins, expand with the utter validity of my hate, which can never<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have enough of you,<br>
        Breathlessly, like two idealists in a broken submarine.<br>
        <br>
